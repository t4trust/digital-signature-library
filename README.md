 
The main function of **.NET Digital Signature Library** is to digitally sign files in PDF, CAdES or PKCS#7 cryptographic standard (.P7S or .P7M files) using X.509 certificates stored on PFX files, smart cards, USB tokens, HSM’s stored on Microsoft Certificate Store.

The positioning of the PDF signature appearance is configurable, plus on which pages of the document it should appear (first page, last page or all pages).

Also, using .NET Digital Signature Library can digitally sign Office, XPS and XML documents using X.509 certificates. Using this library you can quickly digitally sign .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .xps and .xml files using a simple SDK.

.NET Digital Signature Library can be used to create X.509 certificates in PFX format. Using this library you can quickly create PFX digital certificates and custom certificates with different Key usage or Enhanced key usage.

The main function of X509CertificateGenerator class is to issue X.509 Version 3 digital certificates in PFX format. Using this library you can quickly issue all kind of certificates (user, self signed, root, time stamping, digital signature).
